name: grove-worktree-management
description: Use grove for all git worktree management when the project has a `.grove/` directory, when the user mentions worktrees, tmux, parallel work, PR review, Docker per branch, or when an agent needs to switch context without disrupting the user's current work. Always prefer this skill over manual `git worktree add` — grove handles naming, tmux, Docker, and hooks atomically. Use even when the user doesn't say "grove" by name.

# Grove Worktree Management

## When to Use Grove

Use grove instead of manual git worktree commands when:
- The project has a `.grove/` directory (already configured)
- The user needs Docker containers per worktree
- You need to review a PR without disrupting the user's current context
- Multiple features or PRs need parallel development environments
- The user mentions tmux, worktrees, or parallel development

If grove is not installed, refer to [`docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md`](../../docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md) for installation steps.

## Agent Mode Setup

Before any grove command:

```bash
export GROVE_AGENT_MODE=1        # suppress tmux takeover; implies NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER
export GROVE_NONINTERACTIVE=1    # auto-accept all prompts
export GROVE_TUI=0               # disable dashboard
```

> `GROVE_AGENT_MODE=1` suppresses tmux in `grove to` but not session creation in
> `grove new`. To fully disable tmux, set `[tmux] mode = "off"` in config.

## Command Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose | `--json` | Mutates | Aliases |
|---------|---------|:--------:|:-------:|---------|
| `grove new [name]` | Create worktree + branch + Docker + tmux | — | ✓ | `spawn`, `n` |
| `grove to [name]` | Switch context; `--peek` skips hooks/tmux | — | ✓ | `switch`, `t` |
| `grove fetch <pr\|issue>/<n>` | Worktree from GitHub PR/issue (needs `gh`) | — | ✓ | `f` |
| `grove ls` | List all worktrees | ✓ | — | `list`, `l` |
| `grove here` | Current worktree status | ✓ | — | `h` |
| `grove context` | Rich status (ahead/behind, stash, recent commits) | ✓ | — | — |
| `grove test <name>` | Run tests in another worktree | — | — | `tt` |
| `grove ps` | List active isolated Docker slots | ✓ | — | `agent-status` |
| `grove up` | Start Docker; `--isolated [--slot N]` for agent stacks | — | ✓ | `u` |
| `grove down` | Stop Docker; `--slot N` for isolated stacks | — | ✓ | `do` |
| `grove rm [name]` | Remove worktree + branch + tmux + Docker | — | ✓ | `remove`, `delete` |
| `grove doctor [worktree]` | Health check | — | — | — |
| `grove adopt [path]` | Bring raw git worktree under grove management | — | ✓ | — |
| `grove sync [name]` | Sync branch with upstream | — | ✓ | `s` |
| `grove last` | Switch to previous worktree | — | ✓ | `la` |
| `grove diff [name]` | Compare branches | — | — | `compare`, `d` |
| `grove graft <name>` | Apply changes from another worktree | — | ✓ | `apply`, `g` |
| `grove trim` | Remove stale/merged worktrees | — | ✓ | `prune`, `clean`, `tm` |
| `grove join [name]` | Attach to tmux session | — | — | `attach`, `a`, `j` |
| `grove fork [name]` | Fork current worktree into a new one | — | ✓ | `split`, `fo` |
| `grove open [name]` | Open a worktree session (create if needed) | ✓ | ✓ | `o` |
| `grove logs [service]` | View container logs | — | — | `lo` |
| `grove browse` | Open current worktree's PR/issue in the browser | — | — | `b` |

## Critical Rules

- **Worktree naming:** directories default to `{project}-{name}`; projects can override via `[naming] pattern` in `.grove/config.toml`. `grove ls` shows short names; tmux sessions always use canonical `{project}-{name}`.
- **Read-only switching:** `grove to <name> --peek` — skips hooks and tmux. Safe for PR review.
- **Shell directives:** Without `GROVE_SHELL=1`, grove emits `cd:`, `tmux-attach:`, `env:` lines raw. Filter them: `grove to x 2>&1 | grep -vE '^(cd:|tmux-attach(-cc)?:|env:)'`
- **`grove new` and tmux:** `GROVE_AGENT_MODE=1` does NOT suppress tmux session creation in `grove new` — pass `--no-tmux` for that, or set `[tmux] mode = "off"` in config.
- **Trust:** `.grove/hooks.toml` runs as `sh -c` with full env. Run `grove doctor` and check hooks before `grove new`/`grove fetch` in an unfamiliar repo.

## Deterministic Helpers

For common operations where getting the logic right matters, run these Python scripts.
First set a base path — it resolves whether this skill is installed as a plugin
(`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set to the plugin cache) or run from a repo checkout (falls back
to the current directory):

```bash
SCRIPTS="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}/skills/grove-worktree-management/scripts"
```

| Script | Purpose | Invocation |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `probe_state.py` | Normalized status from `grove here --json` + `grove ls --json` | `python3 "$SCRIPTS/probe_state.py"` |
| `strip_directives.py` | Filter directive lines from grove stdout | `grove to x 2>&1 \| python3 "$SCRIPTS/strip_directives.py"` |
| `allocate_slot.py` | Find lowest free isolated Docker slot | `python3 "$SCRIPTS/allocate_slot.py" [--dry-run]` |
| `audit_hooks.py` | Summarize hooks that would run in this repo | `python3 "$SCRIPTS/audit_hooks.py"` |
| `pr_review.py` | Orchestrate PR fetch + peek switch | `python3 "$SCRIPTS/pr_review.py" <PR#> [--dry-run]` |

All scripts: Python 3 stdlib only, `--help` flag, JSON to stdout on success.
