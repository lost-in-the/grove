| `grove context` | — | ✓ | — | Rich status: ahead/behind, stash count, recent commits, tracking branch |
| `grove test <name>` | `tt` | — | — | Run tests in another worktree; args after `--` are passed to test runner |
| `grove ps` | `agent-status` | ✓ | — | List active isolated Docker slots (slot, worktree, compose project, URL) |

| `grove adopt [path]` | — | — | ✓ | Bring a raw `git worktree add` worktree under grove management |
| `grove sync [name]` | `s` | — | ✓ | Sync branch with upstream; without arg syncs current worktree |
| `grove last` | `la` | — | ✓ | Switch to the previous worktree (toggles) |
| `grove diff [name]` | `compare`, `d` | — | — | Compare current branch against another worktree's branch |
| `grove graft <name>` | `apply`, `g` | — | ✓ | Apply uncommitted changes from another worktree into current |
| `grove trim` | `prune`, `clean`, `tm` | — | ✓ | Remove stale or merged worktrees; prompts by default |

| `grove fork <name>` | `split`, `fo` | — | ✓ | Fork current worktree into a new one (branch + copy uncommitted state) |
| `grove logs [name]` | `lo` | — | — | Tail Docker logs for a worktree; defaults to current |
| `grove kick [service]` | `restart`, `k` | — | ✓ | Restart a Docker service in the current worktree's stack |
| `grove rename <new>` | — | — | ✓ | Rename current worktree and update tmux session, branch, Docker project |

## Notes

**Ref format for `grove fetch`:** `pr/42` or `issue/17`. The `gh` CLI must be installed and authenticated.

**`grove new` flags:**
- `--from-branch <branch>` — create worktree tracking an existing branch instead of creating a new one
- `--dirty` — preserve uncommitted changes when creating the worktree

**`grove to` flags:**
- `--peek` — read-only switch: skips pre/post_switch hooks and does not attach tmux. Safe for PR review and parallel inspection.

**`grove trim` flags:**
- `--all` — skip confirmation prompts and remove all stale worktrees at once. Use carefully.

**`grove up` flags:**
- `--isolated` — start a separate Docker stack for this agent session with unique port offsets
- `--slot N` — request a specific slot number (0-based); use with `--isolated`

**`grove down` flags:**
- `--slot N` — stop a specific isolated slot rather than the main stack

**JSON output:** Commands with `--json` emit structured JSON to stdout. Pipe to `jq` or use the `probe_state.py` helper to get a normalized view across multiple commands.

**Aliases are interchangeable:** `grove list`, `grove ls`, and `grove l` behave identically. Canonical names are used in documentation for clarity.

**Mutating commands** change filesystem, git refs, tmux sessions, or Docker state. Non-mutating commands are safe to run at any time without side effects.
